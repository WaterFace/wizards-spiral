Wizard's Spiral

Intro:
You are an *Adventurer*. 

You'd like to think so anyway. Really, it's your first day. You've just left your home town
for the first time in your life, with *the best second-hand set of armor* your pocket money
could afford.

While on your way to the big city to join the *Adventurer's Guild*, you daydream about the
heroic *battles*, foul *monsters*, and *legendary artifacts* you will surely encounter in your
new life as an Adventurer. You smile at a pair of deer frolicking in the roadside field as you
turn a corner.

You should have kept one eye on the road, for your next few steps have you bump into *an old man*
traveling in the opposite direction. The *old man*, dressed in heavy crimson robes, tumbles to the 
ground. You begin to apologize profusely and offer your hand to help him up.

The *old man* bats your hand away, slowly lifting himself to his feet using his *walking stick*,
muttering and grumbling all the way. By the time he's standing, he's shouting at you. *"Fool!"*,
*"Idiot!"*, and the like.

Suddenly, he lifts his *staff* to the sky, which blackens as a torrential downpour begins. 
The *old man* bellows to be heard over the rain: *"I curse you! A thousand lifetimes of travail 
awaits! Begone!"* As the last word leaves his mouth, a bolt of *lighting* strikes his staff.

The light is blinding and the thunder is deafening. But as your senses return to you, you can tell
that you have been transported *elsewhere*. You find yourself in a *small cottage*; it seems normal enough,
but you can tell you're nowhere near your hometown.

Looks like there's a *church* to the north. Maybe you can find out more over there...
